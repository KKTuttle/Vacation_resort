  <h1>Welcome to the Hot Pink Island in Tahiti. Your future favorite resort!</h1>
  <p>Tahiti is the largest island in French Polynesia, the South Pacific archipelago. Shaped like a figure-8, it's divided into Tahiti Nui (the larger, western section) and Tahiti Iti (the eastern peninsula). With black-sand beaches, lagoons, waterfalls and 2 extinct volcanoes, it's a popular vacation destination. Explored by Captain James Cook, it was also frequently painted by French artist Paul Gauguin.</p>
